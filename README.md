# 100_days_of_code_python
This repsitory is for 1. reviewing the Udemy class '100 days of code in Python' by Dr.Angela and 2. refactoring in the future in the future hopefully.
Feel free to refer them (It's messy tho...); Althoguh I refered the class by far, all codes here is written by me from scratch.
